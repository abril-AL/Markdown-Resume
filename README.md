# Markdown-Resume

### You can find the pdf version of my resume at ./resume.pdf
Theres also a markdown version available at ./resume.md

#### Dont look

##### This is mostly taken from this [repository](https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume)
- it goes `md->html->pdf` using: `wkhtml` and `pandoc` ( make sure to have those installed )
- then my make file should handle the big scary commands and create a pdf ( use `make` )
