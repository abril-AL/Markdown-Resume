# Markdown-Resume

Basically, i *didnt* want to make it in docs
**I love markdown**

This is taken from this [repository](https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume)
basically it goes md->html->pdf 
using wkhtml and pandoc ( make sure to have those installed )
then my make file should handle the big scary commands and create a pdf
