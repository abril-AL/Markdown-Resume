## Experience

### Co-Researcher, University of California, San Diego

*2019* â€“ February 2021, Escondido, California

- Worked with a team of co-researches on the UCSD, CREATE project entitles CS-LISTEN, a youth proprietary action research project to investigate the lack of diversity of K-12 computer science education, in both a team setting and as a leader. 
- Our research provided the surveyed school with reccomenced and later implemented changes to respond to our findings; such changes persist.

## Education

### Bachelors of Science, University of California, Los Angeles
- Computer Science, June 2025 (Expected)
  - Member of Crux, IEEE, and SWE
  - Selected Coursework: Software Construction, Operating Systems Principles, Data Abstraction, Data Structures and Algorithms, Algorithms and Complexity, Discrete Structures, Computer Networking, Principles and Practices of Computing
  
## Projects

- BCI Tinder - Crux Neurotech at UCLA, 2022-2023
    - *Implemented a brain computer interface that detects attraction valence based on alpha waves*
    - *Utilized  a varietey of techniques to isolate alpha waves, including FFT algorithm and bandpass filters, and multiple preprocessesing filters*
    - *Led the programming-focused members of the team, managing tasks and the shared remote Git repository*
    - Technologies used: Open BCI GUI, Open BCI Headset and Cyton Board, `Python` (`neurokit 2.0` and `numpy`), MatLab
- Micromouse - IEEE at UCLA, 2022-2023
    - *Aimed to build an autonomous robot with the ability to solve a 16x16 maze*
    - *Used various techniques and disciplines, ie. PID algorithms, maze solving algorithms, and electrical engineering practices*
    - *I acquired skills in lower level interactions between software and hardware, as well as creating and organizing board schematics, and working as a team leader*
    - Technologies used: `Eagle`, `STM Cube IDE`, `C/C++`, variety of parts for creating the mouse PCB board
- Substance Tracker App - UCLA, 2022-2023
    - *Developed an ios app for users to track and view substance use, with data stored and accessed on a remote database, requiring user authentification*
    - *Worked in a team setting, efficiently creating and assigning front-end and back-end specfic tasks, utilizing version control with git for development concurrency*
    - Technologies Used: `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `React`, `React Native`, `Firebase`, `Expo Client`, `Expo Go` , `Git`, `GitHub`
